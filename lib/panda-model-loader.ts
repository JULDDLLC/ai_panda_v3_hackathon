// lib/panda-model-loader.ts
// This file is responsible for loading the 3D Panda model.
// The GLTFLoader import is temporarily commented out to resolve Vercel build errors.

// import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader'; // Temporarily commented out
// import { DRACOLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/DRACOLoader'; // Temporarily commented out
// import * as THREE from 'three'; // Temporarily commented out

// This function would typically load a GLTF model.
// It is now a placeholder as the loader is disabled.
export function loadPandaModel(): Promise<any> { // Change return type if needed
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.warn('3D model loading is currently disabled for deployment.');
    // Simulate a successful load for now, or return null/error
    resolve(null); // Resolve with null or a placeholder object
  });
}

// You might also have other functions related to the 3D model here.
// For example, if you had a function to initialize the scene:
/*
export function initPandaScene(scene: THREE.Scene) {
  // This function would set up the model in the scene
  // This code is also commented out as the loader is disabled.
  console.log('3D scene initialization is disabled.');
}
